## Intro
We are chaBots, an independent student robotics group based in San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico. We believe competitions are the best way to learn robotics. And with the hope of helping other teams, we made our full robot code public in this repo.

chaBots as a group has been competing in the Robocup Mexican Open in 6 years: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2023, 2024 and 2025. But our team members have been competing only **since 2023**.

## Software Needed
- **Solidworks** for CAD
- **Altium** for PCB design
- **Arduino IDE using Teensyduino** for robot code using Teensy 4.1
- **OpenMV IDE** for Computer Vision using OpenMV H7 R2
